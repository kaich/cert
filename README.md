# Installation

**Note**: It is recommended to use [match](https://github.com/fastlane/match) according to the [codesigning.guide](https://codesigning.guide) for generating and maintaining your certificates. Use `cert` directly only if you want full control over what's going on and know more about codesigning.

     gem specific_install https://github.com/kaich/cert.git

Make sure, you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

    xcode-select --install

# Why?

Please check out [this guide](https://github.com/fastlane/cert/blob/master/ManualSteps.md) which shows how to manually create an iOS code signing profile and a provisioning profile using the Apple Developer Portal.

**After** checking out the [guide](https://github.com/fastlane/cert/blob/master/ManualSteps.md), take a look how `cert` and [`sigh`](https://github.com/fastlane/sigh) do all that for you.

![assets/cert.gif](assets/cert.gif) 

In the gif I used `cert && sigh`, which will first create an iOS code signing certificate and then a provisioning profile for your app if `cert` succeeded.

# Usage

    cert

This will check if any of the available signing certificates is installed on your local machine.

Only if a new certificate needs to be created, `cert` will

- Create a new private key
- Create a new signing request
- Generate, downloads and installs the certificate
- Import all the generated files into your Keychain


`cert` will never revoke your existing certificates. If you can't create any more certificates, `cert` will raise an exception, which means, you have to revoke one of the existing certificates to make room for a new one.


You can pass your Apple ID:

    cert -u cert@krausefx.com

For a list of available commands run

    cert --help

Keep in mind, there is no way for `cert` to download existing certificates + private keys from the Apple Developer Portal, as the private key never leaves your computer. 

## Environment Variables

Run `cert --help` to get a list of all available environment variables.

## Use with [`sigh`](https://github.com/fastlane/sigh)

`cert` becomes really interesting when used in [`fastlane`](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) in combination with [`sigh`](https://github.com/fastlane/sigh).

Update your `Fastfile` to contain the following code:

```ruby
lane :beta do
  cert
  sigh(force: true)
end
```

`force: true` will make sure to re-generate the provisioning profile on each run.
This will result in `sigh` always using the correct signing certificate, which is installed on the local machine.


## How is my password stored?
`cert` uses the [password manager](https://github.com/fastlane/credentials_manager) from `fastlane`. Take a look the [CredentialsManager README](https://github.com/fastlane/credentials_manager) for more information.
